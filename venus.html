<h1>One day on venus is longer than one year</h1>
<p id="one"> Due to the slow rotation on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days â€“ making a year on Venus shorter on day on Venus.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to other planets</h1>
<p id="one"> Most other planets rotate counter-clockwise on their axis, however Venus, like Uranus, rotates clockwise. This is known as a retrograde rotation and may have been caused by a collision with an asteroid or other object which caused the planet to change its rotational path.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The estimated age of the Venusian surface is around 300-400 million years old.</h1>
<p id="one">By comparison, the surface of the Earth is about 100 million years old.</p>
