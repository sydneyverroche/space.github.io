		<strong>New evidence</strong> suggests the 
		first known black 
		hole is bigger than 
		previously thought, which 
		may force scientists to reconsider
		their understanding of how giant stars 
		give rise to black holes. Scientists 
		think stellar-mass black holes, which 
				contain up to a few times the sun's mass, 
					form when giant stars die and collapse in 
						on themselves. The first black hole ever 
							discovered was Cygnus X-1, located within 
								the Milky Way in the constellation of Cygnus, 
								the Swan. Astronomers saw the first signs of the 
									black hole in 1964 via gas it sucked away from a 
										closely orbiting blue supergiant star.As this gas 
											spiraled into the black hole, it became so hot it 
											emitted high-energy X-rays and gamma-rays that satellites
													could detect. A trio of studies in 2011 suggested 
														Cygnus X-1 was located about 6,070 light-years 
															 from Earth, but the new research suggests 
																the black hole is actually about 7,240 
																	   light-years away. Because other 
																		 characteristics of the object 
																	 are calculated based on distance, 
																	  the new calculation argues that 
																	 Cygnus X-1 is quite a bit larger 
																	 than scientists had realized.
		
		
		







																	To estimate the black hole's 
																	distance, scientists use the 
																	so-called parallax technique, 
																	which examines Cygnus X-1 
																	compared to its background. 
																"If you hold a finger at arm's 
																 length and close one eye and then 
															  the other, you will see it [your 
														finger] appear to move from one spot 
													mto another in comparison with more distant 
												background objects," James Miller-Jones, an 
											astrophysicist at the Curtin University node 
										of the International Center for Radio Astronomy
									Research in Perth, Australia, lead author on the 
								new study and co-author on some of the 2011 
								research, told Space.com. "Using that same 
							idea, one can calculate how far away 
							Cygnus X-1 was by looking at it from 
						different vantage points as Earth 
					moved around the sun." The 2011 
				work analyzed the light from 
			the black hole's companion 
		star to help estimate the star’s 
		diameter. With this measurement, 
		researchers calculated other 
		details of the partnership, 
		such as the black hole's mass, 
		suggesting it was about 14.8 times 
		that of the sun. However, the 2011 
		research did not collect data from 
		the black hole throughout a full 
		orbit around its companion star. 











											  Without that information, 
											the prior work could not fully 
										 account for how these orbital motions 
									  might affect the distance and mass estimates.
								  In the new study, Miller-Jones and his colleagues 
								analyzed observations of Cygnus X-1 from the Very Long 
							   Baseline Array (VLBA), a giant radio telescope made of 10 
							dishes scattered across the U.S. Over the course of six 12-hour
						  -long observations carried out on consecutive days, the researchers 
						monitored the full orbit of the black hole. Using the parallax technique 
					   on this new data combined with the 2011 data, the scientists found the black 
					 hole may be farther away that previously thought, about 7,240 light-years from Earth. 
					 These new findings led the researchers to revise what models of the motions of Cygnus 
					 X-1's companion star, which in turn led to a new estimated mass for the black hole — 
					 about 21.2 times that of the sun. This size makes Cygnus X-1 the largest stellar-mass 
					 black hole detected to date with observations of light. (Gravitational-wave observato-
					 ries such as LIGO that detect ripples in the fabric of space and time have detected 
					   larger stellar-mass black holes, including one about 50 times the sun's mass.)
						 These findings suggest that the stars that form stellar-mass black holes 
						   may not lose as much material via winds as previously thought. "The 
						    mass of a black hole is set by how massive a star it started off 
						      as," Miller-Jones said. "Stars lose mass as winds blowing off 
						        their surface, and massive stars generate more powerful  
						          winds. The most massive stars can have very powerful 
						             winds, and lose a lot of mass through them 
						               before they form black holes." The newfound 
						                  giant size of Cygnus X-1 therefore 
						                     suggests the stars that form 
						                     	tellar-mass black holes
						                     	   an be larger than 
						                     	     previously 
						                     	      thought. 










"Previous models predicted the most massive black hole a massive star 
in our Milky Way galaxy should be able to make should only be about 15 times 
the mass of the sun," Miller-Jones said. "So finding something 21 times the mass 
of the sun means we have to revise our estimates of how much mass these massive stars are losing."









																	The updated estimates of the black hole's 
																	mass and distance also helped revealed the 
																	object is spinning very close to the speed 
																	of light, "faster than any other black hole 
																	found to date," study co-author Xueshan Zhao 
																	at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
																	Beijing, said in a statement.










							And even larger stellar-mass black 
							holes may be waiting for scientists' 
							ttention. "Cygnus X-1 is 
							unlikely the 
							most massive 
							stellar-mass 
							black hole that 
							can be produced," 
							Miller-Jones said. 
							"The question is can 
							we identify them, and 
							how accurately can we measure 
							their masses?"

							The scientists detailed 
							their findings online 
							Feb. 18 in the journal Science. 
							Two other papers focusing on 
							different aspects of this work 
							also appeared Feb. 18 in 
							The Astrophysical Journal.
