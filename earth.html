	The 
	Earth 
	was 
	once 
	believed 
	to 
	be 
	the 
	centre 
	of 
	the 
	universe. 
	For 
	2000 
	years 
	ancient 
	astronomers 
	believed 
	that 
	the 
	Earth 
	was 
	static 
	and 
	had 
	other 
	celestial 
	bodies 
	travelling 
	in 
	circular 
	orbits 
	around 
	it. 
	They 
	believed 
	this 
	because 
	of 
	the 
	apparent 
	movement 
	on 
	the 
	Sun 
	and 
	planets 
	in 
	relation 
	to 
	their 
	viewpoint. 
	In 
	1543, 
	Copernicus 
	published 
	his 
	Sun-centered 
	model 
	of 
	the 
	Solar
	System
	which 
	put 
	the 
	Sun 
	at 
	the 
	centre 
	of 
	our 
	solar 
	system.
